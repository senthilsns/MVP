Model View Presenter

Platform : Xcode 10
Language : Swift 4.2


Model is an interface  responsible for the domain data (to be displayed or otherwise acted upon in the GUI)

View is responsible for the presentation layer (GUI)

Presenter is the "middle-man" between Model and View. It reacts to the user’s actions performed on the View, retrieves data from the Model, and formats it for display in the View
